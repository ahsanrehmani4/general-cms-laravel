# Basic General CMS - Laravel

Hey! This is Ahsen Alee, an experienced developer currently working on the development of a basic, open-source CMS (Content Management System) dashboard using the Laravel framework. This comprehensive dashboard is designed to cater to both beginner and advanced level projects and is widely utilized by developers. I am looking for contributors who would be willing to collaborate on this project and help enhance its features.

If someone passionate about Laravel development and would like to contribute to an open-source project, I would be thrilled to have them on board. Together, we can create a reliable and versatile dashboard that meets the needs of developers across various levels of expertise.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in joining this exciting endeavor.
